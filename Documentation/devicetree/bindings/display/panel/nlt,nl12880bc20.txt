NLT Technologies Ltd. NL12880BC20 12.1" WXGA LVDS panel

Note: The output format of the display can be configured via two
      control pins (FRC, MSL). Depending on the strapping of those
      pins the appropriate 'compatible' string has to be used.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
   - "nlt,nl12880bc20-spwg-18" for SPWG (18bpp) FRC: Low or open, MSL: Low or open
   - "nlt,nl12880bc20-spwg-24" for SPWG (24bpp) FRC: High, MSL: High
   - "nlt,nl12880bc20-jeida" for JEIDA          FRC: High, MSL: High

This binding is compatible with the simple-panel binding, which is specified
in simple-panel.txt in this directory.
