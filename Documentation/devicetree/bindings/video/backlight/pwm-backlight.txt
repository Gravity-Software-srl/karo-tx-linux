pwm-backlight bindings

Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the
      array defined by the "brightness-levels" property)

Optional properties:
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
               "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0])
  - low-threshold-brightness: brightness threshold low level. Low threshold
    brightness set to value so that backlight present on low end of
    brightness.
    Some panels, backlight would absent if duty percentage of PWM wave is less
    than certain level (say 20%). By setting low-threshold-brightness to a
    value above (percentage of brightness-levels max) 50 (20% of 255, if 255
    is max). On setting low-threshold-brightness, range of brightness-levels
    is calculated in a region of low-threshold-brightness to brightness-levels
    max.

Example:

	backlight {
		compatible = "pwm-backlight";
		pwms = <&pwm 0 5000000>;

		brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
		default-brightness-level = <6>;
		low-threshold-brightness = <50>;
	};
